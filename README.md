# Nightlife Coordination

The purpose of the project is to provide the Nightlife Coordination.

## UX

As an unauthenticated user, you can view all bars in my area.

As an authenticated user, you can add myself to a bar to indicate that you are going there tonight.

As an authenticated user, you can remove myself from a bar if you no longer want to go there.

As an unauthenticated user, when you login you should not have to search again.

Try using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3) to find venues in the cities that your users search for.
